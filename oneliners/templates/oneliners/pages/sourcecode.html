    <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
        The site is far from what we want it to be.
        Mainly we need more Django developers.
        But also reviewers of the contributed one-liners, to improve or remove those that are sub-optimal.
        At the minimum it would help a lot if you could spread the word and talk about this site
        on Twitter, Google+, Facebook, Reddit or other social media.
    </div>

    <p>
        This page should give you all the links,
        resources and contact info that you might need to participate in this project.
        Do <a href="mailto:info@bashoneliners.com">let us know</a> if we missed something.
    </p>

    <p>Right now the site is still pretty far from what we want it to be. Our next bigger goals:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Perfect one-liners following today's best-practices:</strong>
            Expert users should be able to edit and improve poorly written one-liners.
            The site needs peer-review and collaborative editing features,
            similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>, but a bit differently.
            On Stack Overflow, answers do not collaborate with each other,
            and sometimes the accepted answer is not optimal.
            Sometimes the best answer would be a combination of multiple answers.
            Our goal here is to encourage users to optimize the heck out of every single one-liner until it is perfect.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gamification:</strong>
            Gamification features could be important to attract and motivate contributions.
            Designing the system is a very complex subject, it takes much more than just coding.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To make all these things happen we need more Django coders,
        espeically with gamification experience.</p>
