        <li>Before you post, please do a quick search to check if a similar one-liner already exists. If it does, and
            you think your version is better, you can post it as an <em>alternative</em> one-liner, and the two will be
            linked together.
        </li>
        <li>Please post only non-trivial, practical one-liners that are actually useful for something in real life, and
            in not too limited situations. Pure awesome wicked-cool one-liners are OK too.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>Explanation</strong> is very important. The purpose of this site is to teach, not to show off.
            Please write nicely, explain clearly, as if teaching a trick to a friend.
